# GoScenic Mobile

This directory contains a minimal React Native skeleton for the GoScenic mobile application for both iOS and Android. The structure is intentionally lightweight so developers can build upon it. Features are inspired by Roadtrippers, focusing on scenic route planning and trip management.

To get started, install the dependencies and run the Expo development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This uses [Expo](https://expo.dev) for quick prototyping and testing across mobile devices. The app simply renders a placeholder screen which you can replace with real functionality.
