# GoScenic Web

This directory contains a minimal Next.js setup for the desktop web version of GoScenic. It provides a baseline structure similar to Roadtrippers for building scenic route and itinerary features.

To begin development:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The example page at `/pages/index.js` is a placeholder that you can expand with real components.
